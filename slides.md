# Oscillator Frequency

## Amplitude and Frequency

There are two main properties of a regular vibration - the amplitude and the frequency - which affect the way it sounds. 



## Amplitude
Amplitude is the size of the vibration, and this determines how loud the sound is.  We have already seen that larger vibrations make a louder sound. 


**Amplitude** is important when balancing and controlling the loudness of sounds, such as with the volume control on your CD player.  It is also the origin of the word amplifier, a device which increases the amplitude of a waveform.

## Frequency
Frequency is the speed of the vibration, and this determines the pitch of the sound.  It is only useful or meaningful for musical sounds, where there is a strongly regular waveform.

**Frequency** is measured as the number of wave cycles that occur in one second.  The unit of frequency measurement is Hertz (Hz for short).
A frequency of 1 Hz means one wave cycle per second.  A frequency of 10 Hz means ten wave cycles per second, where the cycles are much shorter and closer together.
