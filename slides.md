## Amplitude and Frequency

There are two main properties of a regular vibration - the amplitude and the frequency - which affect the way it sounds. 

Amplitude is the size of the vibration, and this determines how loud the sound is.  We have already seen that larger vibrations make a louder sound.

Amplitude is important when balancing and controlling the loudness of sounds, such as with the volume control on your CD player.  It is also the origin of the word amplifier, a device which increases the amplitude of a waveform.
